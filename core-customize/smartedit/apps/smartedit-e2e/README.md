<h1 align="center">SmartEdit E2E</h1>
The smartedit-e2e library contains the end-to-end tests of the SmartEdit extension.

## Prerequisites

To execute the smartedit-e2e library it must be added to `rush.json`. To do this, please build the smartedittools as described in the [smartedittools README.md](../../#commands). Once this is done, the smartedit-e2e will have a copy of node_modules in it.

> ðŸš§ Important Note
>
> Never execute `npm install` directly on the smartedit-e2e library folder. The smartedit-e2e library and all other npm packages in the SmartEdit repository are managed only through the Rush tooling.
