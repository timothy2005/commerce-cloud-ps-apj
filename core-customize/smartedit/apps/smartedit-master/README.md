<h1 align="center">SmartEdit Master</h1>
The smartedit-master library links all the libraries (as defined in the package.json) in the SmartEdit ecosystem and compiles them into JS and CSS files that can be loaded by the browser. 
	
## Prerequisites

To execute the smartedit-master library it must be added to `rush.json`. To do this, please build the smartedittools as described in the [smartedittools README.md](../../#commands). Once this is done, the smartedit-master will have a copy of node_modules in it.

> ðŸš§ Important Note
>
> Never execute `npm install` directly on the smartedit-master library folder. The smartedit-master library and all other npm packages in the SmartEdit repository are managed only through the Rush tooling.
