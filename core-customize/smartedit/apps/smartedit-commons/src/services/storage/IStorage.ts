 *  Represents a data access point, but depending on the implementation doesn't
 *  necessarily contain the stored data directly. For example a cloud storage implementation might access the remote
 *  storage via REST on a get(), or it might fetch the whole storage and keep it in memory.
 *
 *  This interface is kept purposely un-opinionated to support a variety of storage types.
 *
 *  # Generics
 *  The interface requires two generics types be provided,
 *
 *  ### Q extends Cloneable
 *  This is the query type for the storage. In a typical key-value storage this is often a string key type, but
 *  in a more complex storage implementation, for instance indexedDb, this could be a query object.
 *  ### D extends Cloneable
 *  This represents the type of data being stored.
 *
 *  # Cloneable
 *  The IStorage interface does not allow any data or query types, they must extend the Cloneable interface.
 *  This is because the data must be able to be serialized, both for remote storages, and for storages that live in
 *  the inner smartedit application, as this data is passed over the w3c postMessage() between frames.
