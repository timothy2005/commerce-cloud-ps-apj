/**
 * This file contains a plugin used in PostCSS to rewrite URLs found while processing .css files. This might be helpful when importing a
 * stylesheet from an external library; the URLs in the stylesheet probably are not relative to the current URL and they might not be
 * properly referenced when used in SmartEdit. By rewriting the URL we ensure that it is relative to the current library and that the
 * assets can be found whenever needed in SmartEdit.
 *
 * The plugin accepts an object of type PostcssRewriteUrlPluginOptions as input, which contains an array with the rules to rewrite URLs.
 * Each rule contains a pattern that the plugin will use to identify the URLs that need rewriting and a path to the location where the
 * assets being referenced reside. For example, the following rule is telling the plugin to rewrite any URL matching '../../img/*.png'
 * and that the assets are actually found in the path 'node_modules/example/img/'.
 *  {
 *      urlMatcher: '../../img/*.png',
 *      assetsLocation: 'node_modules/example/img/'
 *  }
 *
 * Please note that whenever a URL is rewritten, the corresponding asset is copied over to the /dist/assets folder.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - This is not a Rollup plugin. Instead, it is a PostCSS plugin.
 * - In practice, it is recommended to rewrite URLs with this approach for .css or .sass files only. Urls in .less files should be
 *   processed by the less-plugin.
 * - This is executed after SASS files have been compiled.
