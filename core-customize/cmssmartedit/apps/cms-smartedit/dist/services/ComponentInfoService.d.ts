/**
 * This service is used to fetch and cache components information.
 * This service keeps track of components added, edited and removed. It also automatically fetches and caches components when they are visible in the viewport (and invalidates them).
 *
 * This service is intended to be used to improve the performance of the application by reducing the number of xhr calls to the cmsitems api.
 * Example:
 * - a component in the overlay that is doing a fetch to the cmsitems api should use this service instead of using cmsitemsRestService.
 *   When a lot of components are rendered in the overlay we want to avoid one xhr call per component, but instead use this service that is listening
 *   to the 'OVERLAY_RERENDERED_EVENT' and fetch components information in batch (POST to cmsitems endpoint with an Array of uuids).

     * - If the component is in the cache, the promise resolves right away.
     * - If the component is not in the cache, and the forceRetrieval flag is not set, this method won't call the cmsItem backend API right away.
     *   Instead, it waits until the component is cached (e.g., it is added to the overlay).
     * - If the forceRetrieval flag is set, then the method will call the cmsItem backend API right away.
     *
     * @param uuid The uuid of the item to retrieve
     * @param forceRetrieval Boolean flag. It specifies whether to retrieve the cmsItem right away.
     * @returns Promise that will be resolved only if the component was added previously in the overlay and if not will resolve only when the component is added to the overlay.
