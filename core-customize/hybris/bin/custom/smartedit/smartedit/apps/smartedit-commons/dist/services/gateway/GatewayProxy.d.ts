/**
 * To seamlessly integrate the gateway factory between two services on different frames, you can use a gateway
 * proxy. The gateway proxy service simplifies using the gateway module by providing an API that registers an
 * instance of a service that requires a gateway for communication.
 *
 * This registration process automatically attaches listeners to each of the service's functions (turned into promises), allowing stub
 * instances to forward calls to these functions using an instance of a gateway from {@link GatewayFactory}.
 * Any function that has an empty body declared on the service is used as a proxy function.
 * It delegates a publish call to the gateway under the same function name, and wraps the result of the call in a Promise.
