 * The Message Gateway is a private channel that is used to publish and subscribe to events across iFrame
 * boundaries. The gateway uses the W3C-compliant postMessage as its underlying technology. The benefits of
 * the postMessage are that:
 *
 *      <ul>
 *          <li>It works in cross-origin scenarios.</li>
 *          <li>The receiving end can reject messages based on their origins.</li>
 *      </ul>
 *
 * The creation of instances is controlled by the {@link GatewayFactory}.
 * Only one instance can exist for each gateway ID.
